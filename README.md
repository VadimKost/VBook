# VBook
An application for audiobooks lowers.
Work on the project is temporarily suspended.
I plan to globally update the project (using the new kotlin gradle dsl, using ddd approaches, significantly improve the quality of the code).

Existing features:
---------
- [x] Search and get new books from sites
- [x] Book playback
- [x] Book offline playback.
- [ ] Searching in different sources
